## DETAILED STOCK-BY-STOCK ANALYSIS

### 1. TTD (Trade Desk) - ✅ CLEARED

**Initial Concern:** High stock compensation eating into returns

**Actual Status:**
- SBC declined to 16% of revenue (industry average for SaaS)

- Repurchased ~$2 billion since 2023
- New $500M buyback authorized Oct 2025
- No debt on balance sheet
- $1.4B cash position

**Verdict:** ✅ **NOT A RED FLAG** - TTD is actually reducing shares effectively. CEO compensation is performance-based (only vests at higher stock prices). Keep in universe.

**Actual Status:**
- Simply Wall St: "Shareholders have not been meaningfully diluted in the past year"

## KEY INSIGHT

**Most "dilution" concerns were overblown.** After deep research:

1. **TTD** - Actually doing aggressive, effective buybacks
2. **MNKD** - Management actively avoiding dilution
3. **CELH** - No meaningful dilution in past year
4. **MELI** - Growth ROIIC far exceeds dilution cost

**Only BRFS has genuine red flags** - commodity exposure + EM governance + dilutive capital raises. This is not a compounder.

**New Rule for Framework:**
> Dilution is acceptable IF: ROIIC > Cost of Equity + Dilution Rate
> 
> Example: MELI has 38% ROIIC vs ~12% cost of equity + 1% dilution = 25% spread = VALUE CREATING
