## KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Most compounders prefer buybacks over dividends** - They see better return reinvesting in their business or buying back shares

2. **Dividend payers tend to be more mature** - Industrial, pharma, and consumer staples companies

3. **High yield doesn't always mean better** - BBW (4.5%) may cut if retail struggles; ADP (2.0%) has 49 years of growth

4. **Best dividend growers:**
   - ADP: 49 consecutive years of increases
   - TJX: 48% 5-year dividend growth rate
   - MRK: 16 consecutive years

5. **For income, consider Cash Cows with high shareholder yield (dividends + buybacks)** rather than just dividend yield
