# 🔍 LOW COMPOUNDING POWER ANALYSIS
## Securities with Zero Comp Power + Low VCR + Negative Reinvestment

Generated: February 2, 2026

---

## THE QUESTION

Why are stocks with:
- **Zero compounding power** (not growing intrinsic value)
- **Low VCR (<2x)** (barely creating value above cost of capital)
- **Negative reinvestment** (shrinking invested capital)

...in a "Capital Compounders" universe?

---

## FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATION

A stock should STAY if:
1. **High VCR (3x+)** = Strong moat, returning excess capital is rational
2. **High ROIC (25%+)** = Exceptional business, just mature
3. **Special circumstances** = Financial services, unique business model

A stock should GO if:
1. **Low VCR (<2x)** + **Low ROIC (<20%)** = Weak moat, weak returns
2. **Commodity-like business** = No pricing power
3. **Declining fundamentals** = Moat eroding

## KEY PRINCIPLE APPLIED

> **A "Capital Compounder" must either:**
> 1. **Compound capital** at high ROIIC (Machines), OR
> 2. **Return capital** from a **strong moat** (VCR 2x+)
>
> Stocks with VCR < 2x AND zero compounding power are neither compounding NOR have strong moats. They're just... average businesses returning capital.
